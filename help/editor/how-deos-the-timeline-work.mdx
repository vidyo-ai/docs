title: "How does the Timeline work?"
---

The timeline is the heart of [Quso.ai](http://Quso.ai)â€™s video editor. It's where you can view, arrange, and edit your content. Whether youâ€™re trimming clips, adding subtitles, or syncing audio, the timeline gives you complete control over the structure and flow of your video.

## ðŸ§± What is the timeline?

The timeline is a **horizontal panel at the bottom** of the video editor. 

## ðŸŽ¬ What can it be used for?

You can use this timeline to:

### **Trim or split video clips**

- Hover over the **edges** of a clip and drag inward to trim.
- Use the **scissors tool** to split a clip into two sections.

### **Zoom in/out for precision**

- Use the zoom slider on the timeline to **get a closer view** of your clips for fine-tuned edits.

### **Select timestamps**

- You can directly copy the timestamp to add media such as b-roll or images with great precision.

### **Add/edit scenes using the CutMagic tool**

- You can also add scenes for CutMagic using the timeline.
