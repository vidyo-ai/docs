### **Step 4: Keep the Duration Limit in Mind**

- The maximum duration for any clip is **2 minutes**.
- You won't be able to extend beyond this limit ‚Äî even if your source video is longer.

### **Step 5: Done\!**

- Once you‚Äôve adjusted the end time, your clip will now include the extended portion.
- Preview your changes to make sure everything looks good.

<Tip>
  Similarly, if you want to remove some parts, you can drag the end marker to the left.

  This can also be done with the start marker.
