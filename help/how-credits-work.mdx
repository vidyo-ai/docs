## What are credits?

Credits are the units used for video creation within quso.ai. Each minute of video you upload consumes one credit. For example, processing a 10-minute video will use 10 credits.

Credits are only used when you upload a video. Once uploaded, you can edit, publish to social media, or download clips without using any additional credits.

If you are on an **annual plan**, you’ll receive all your credits for the full 12 months upfront.\
If you are on a **monthly plan**, you’ll receive your credits one month at a time.

## Calculation of credit usage

For **AI Clips, AI Captions, AI Writer** features credits are calculated by length of the imported video. For example, if your imported video is 42 minutes in length, you will use up 42 credits.

- Videos less than 1 min are rounded up to 1 credit. (Eg, a 40-second video is rounded up and will use up 1 credit)
- Videos with partial minutes are also rounded up to the nearest minute (Eg. 25 min 40 sec long it will use up 26 credits)

For **AI Influencer & AI Text to Video**, the approximate length of the final video is the number of credits you will use up.

<Info>
  Credit usage is always shown upfront before you start any processing or any deduction of credits.

## Credit Refunds

Any credits deducted for videos or projects that did not process will be auto-refunded.\
If you are not happy with the output, you can reach out to us, and we will reimburse the credits for you.

## Do credits expire?

Credits from your **base plan** expire at the end of each subscription period.

- If you're on a **monthly plan**, unused credits will **not roll over** to the next month.
- If you're on an **annual plan**, credits will reset at the end of the 12-month period.

However, this **does not apply to add-on credits** purchased separately. These **do not expire** and can be used at any time.

## How do I get more credits?

There are many different ways to get more credits:

- **Adding Credits**\
  You can add more credits to your plan anytime by clicking the **"Add Credits"** button located at the bottom left of the home page. Each credit costs **\$0.15**, though the price may vary based on your region.

- **Upgrading Your Plan**\
  Need more credits or additional features? You can upgrade to a higher-tier plan to receive more monthly credits along with access to all the benefits that come with that tier.
- **Switching to an Annual Plan**\
  Switching from a monthly to an annual plan gives you all 12 months’ worth of credits upfront—perfect for those who prefer to plan ahead or use more credits at once.

## How are credits consumed in my team workspace?

Only the **team owner** can purchase a paid plan for the team. Once the plan is active, **credits are shared** across all team members.
