## What is a Virality Score?

Think of the virality score as a popularity predictor for your video clips. It tells you how likely a clip is to become popular and widely shared on social media.

Every clip gets a score between **75 and 99 points**:

- **95-99**: Exceptional clips with viral potential - Your best content\!
- **90-94**: Excellent clips that should perform very well
- **85-89**: Very good clips likely to get great engagement
- **80-84**: Good clips worth sharing
- **75-79**: Average clips that may need improvement

## The Four Key Categories We Evaluate

We analyze your clips across four important categories that determine social media success:

### 1. **Trends**

- **What it measures**: How relevant and timely your content is
- **Why it matters**: Content about current topics and trends gets more views
- **Example**: A clip discussing recent events or trending topics scores well here

### 2. **Hook & Flow**

- **What it measures**: How complete and engaging your content is
- **Why it matters**: Viewers need a clear story that keeps them watching from start to finish
- **Example**: A clip with a strong opening, engaging middle, and satisfying conclusion scores high

### 3. **Engagement**

- **What it measures**: How much emotion and discussion your content creates
- **Why it matters**: Content that makes people feel something or want to comment performs better
- **Example**: An inspiring story or thought-provoking topic that sparks conversation

### 4. **Shareability**

- **What it measures**: How likely people are to share your content
- **Why it matters**: Shares are the key to viral growth - one share can lead to hundreds more
- **Example**: Useful tips, entertaining moments, or unique insights that people want to show others

## How We Calculate the Score: A Simple Explanation

Our AI system reads through each clip and evaluates it across all four categories. Here's what happens:

### The Process is Like a Judge at a Competition

Imagine a talent show where judges rate performances on different aspects - stage presence, creativity, audience appeal, etc. Similarly, our AI "judges" each clip on the four categories shown above.

### All Categories Work Together

A great clip usually scores well in multiple categories. For example:

- A clip about a trending topic (high **Trends** score)
- With a compelling story (high **Hook & Flow** score)
- That makes people laugh (high **Engagement** score)
- And contains useful tips (high **Shareability** score)

This would get a score close to 99\!

### The Final Score

After evaluating all four categories, the system calculates a final score between 75 and 99. Clips that excel in multiple categories get higher scores, while clips weak in several areas get lower scores.

## What Happens Behind the Scenes?

When you upload a video, here's the simple process:

1. **Your video is divided into clips** - We find the most interesting segments
2. **Similar clips are removed** - No duplicates to confuse you
3. **Each clip is evaluated** - Our AI reviews all four categories for every clip
4. **Clips are ranked** - From best to worst based on their evaluation
5. **Final scores assigned** - Top clips get scores near 99, others distributed down to 75

## Understanding Your Results

When you see a clip's score:

- **Score 95-99**: This is your BEST content - prioritize sharing these\!
- **Score 90-94**: Excellent clips that should perform very well
- **Score 85-89**: Very good clips worth posting
- **Score 80-84**: Good clips for your regular posting schedule
- **Score 75-79**: Average clips - consider if they add value to your audience

## Why This Matters

Understanding virality scores helps you:

- Identify your best content quickly
- Know which clips to prioritize for social media
- Understand what makes content shareable
- Improve future content creation
- Save time by focusing on high-potential clips

Remember: The virality score is a prediction based on content analysis, not a guarantee. Actual performance depends on many factors including timing, audience, and platform algorithms. Use these scores as a guide to make informed decisions about your content strategy.
