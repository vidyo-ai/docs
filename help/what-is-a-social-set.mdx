The **Social Sets** feature in **Quso.ai** helps you manage multiple social media accounts with ease. Each Social Set acts as a group of connected social accounts—one for each platform—allowing you to organize and publish content efficiently.

## 🧩 What is a Social Set?

When you first purchase a subscription, you are automatically allotted **one free Social Set**.\
Each Social Set lets you connect **one account per supported platform**.

<Tip>
  For example, a single Social Set can include one Instagram account, one Facebook page, one LinkedIn account, and so on.

## 💼 Why Use Multiple Social Sets?

If you manage **multiple clients** or **different brands/pages** on various platforms, Social Sets make it easy to keep them separate and organized.\
Each additional Social Set acts as a unique workspace for another client or brand—perfect for agencies, social media managers, or creators handling multiple projects.
