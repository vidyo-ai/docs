title: "LinkedIn Troubleshooting: Company Page Not Showing"
---

If you notice that a LinkedIn company page is not appearing in the list of available companies on **Quso.ai**, this is a common issue caused by page role permissions.

---

## **Why does this happen?**

\
LinkedIn requires that users have the correct administrative role to access company pages. If you are not a **Super Admin** or **Content Admin** of the company page, it will not appear when connecting your account to **Quso.ai**.

---

## **How to Fix It**

\
To resolve this issue, the current **Super Admin** of the company page needs to update their role. Once you have either Super Admin or Content Admin access, the company page will become visible in **Quso.ai**.

**Steps for Super Admins**:

1. Log in to LinkedIn and navigate to the company page.
2. Click on **Admin Tools** → **Manage Admins**.
3. Add the user or update their role to **Super Admin** or **Content Admin**.
4. Save the changes.
5. Reconnect the LinkedIn account in **Quso.ai**.

After these steps, the company page should appear in the available companies list.
