title: "Troubleshooting Facebook and Instagram Linking Issues"
---

If you're having trouble connecting your Facebook or Instagram accounts to **quso.ai**, this guide walks you through the most common issues and how to fix them.

---

## Recently Created Facebook or Instagram Accounts

Newly created Facebook and Instagram accounts are often restricted by Meta for security reasons. These accounts may not be allowed to connect to external apps immediately. If your account is less than a week old, you may receive errors such as “Could not connect” or “Connection failed.”

We recommend using accounts that are at least **7 days old** to avoid this limitation. You can retry linking after some time.

---

## No Facebook Pages Showing

If you don’t see any Facebook Pages when linking:

- Ensure the Page is at least **7 days old**.
- Only **Business Pages** can be linked; Personal Pages are not supported.
- Make sure you are an **Admin** of the Page.
- If you inherited admin rights through another page, this may not work—direct admin access is required.
- You may need to refresh your permissions by reauthorizing Facebook.

---

## Missing Facebook Pages During Linking

If some Pages are not appearing when linking:

- Verify you are the **admin** or **owner** of the Page.
- Check that permissions were fully granted during linking.
- Look for the **Edit Settings** button during the Facebook authorization pop-up, and ensure all pages are selected.
- If you do not see the “Edit Settings” or a pop-up during linking does not appear, please see how to [**reauthorize Facebook**](https://www.ayrshare.com/docs/help-center/technical-support/facebook_posting_issues).

---

## Grant All Permissions

When linking Facebook or Instagram, make sure to:

- Approve **all permissions** requested by **quso.ai**.
- Allow pop-ups in your browser.
- Ensure no permissions are turned off after linking, as this may break the connection.

## Instagram Profile Type Issues

Instagram allows linking **only if the account is Business or Creator**.

### Check Your Instagram Account Type

1. Open the Instagram app.
2. Go to **Settings → Account**.
3. Look for **Switch Account Type** at the bottom.

If you see **Switch to Personal Account**, then you’re already on a Business/Creator profile.\
If not, switch to **Business** or **Creator**.

### If the Account Type Is Stuck or Incorrect

Switch your account:

1. Change to **Personal**.
2. Then switch back to **Business or Creator**.

This resets the profile and often fixes the linking issue.

---

## Instagram Must Be Linked to a Facebook Page

Instagram Business/Creator accounts require an attached Facebook Page before they can be linked to **quso.ai**.

### Verify the Connection

- Make sure the Instagram account is linked to a Facebook Page under **Instagram → Settings → Account → Sharing to Other Apps**.
- Ensure the correct Page is selected.

If the wrong Page is connected, update it and try linking again in [quso.ai](http://quso.ai).

## Facebook or Instagram Not Loading During Linking

If **Quso.ai** shows an error that Facebook could not load, your browser may be blocking Meta’s login pop-up or SDK. VPNs, ad blockers, and strict privacy settings can interfere with the linking process.

Disable any VPNs or tracking blockers and ensure your browser’s tracking protection is set to **Standard**. Then reload **Quso.ai** and attempt linking again.

### Browser-Specific Fixes

#### Microsoft Edge

Settings → Privacy → Tracking Prevention → Set to **Balanced**

#### Firefox

Settings → Privacy → Enhanced Tracking Protection → Set to **Standard**

Then reload **quso.ai** and retry linking.

## Reset All Facebook Permissions

If all else fails, you can reset Facebook permissions for [quso.ai](http://quso.ai):

1. Go to Facebook settings → **Business Integrations** or **Apps and Websites**.
2. Remove the Ayrshare app..
3. Return to [quso.ai](http://quso.ai) and link again from scratch.

This refreshes all permissions and often resolves persistent linking issues.
