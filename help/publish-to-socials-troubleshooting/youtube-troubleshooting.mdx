title: "YouTube Channels Not Showing in Quso.ai"
---

When you authorize **Quso.ai** to access your YouTube account, Google requires you to select a Google account and then choose a specific channel. Sometimes, one or more of your channels may not appear in the selection list, typically the channel you want to connect to the YouTube API.

Google controls which channels appear based on the account you use, your permission level on each channel, and the privacy settings configured for the channel.

### Common Reasons Your YouTube Channel May Be Missing

**1. Channel Required**

- You must have at least one YouTube channel, and your account must be the owner of the channel.
- To create a channel, click your profile in YouTube and select **Create a Channel**, or use this link: [Create YouTube Channel](http://m.youtube.com/create_channel).

**2. Owner or Admin of the Channel**

- The Google account you use to log in must be the owner or admin of the channel for it to appear.
- Check your brand account permissions to confirm you have the necessary access. If your channel is missing, ask the owner to add you as a manager or owner.

**3. Channel Privacy Settings**

- Channels set to **Private** or **Unlisted** will not be accessible via the API.
- You can test this by searching for the channel in an incognito browser. Private or unlisted channels will not appear in search results.
- Private channels are visible only to the owner and authorized users, while unlisted channels require a direct URL to access.

**4. Age or Region Restrictions**

- Channels with age-restricted content or region-specific restrictions may not appear.
- Age-restricted channels require viewers to be signed in and meet the age requirements to access content.

**5. Deleted or Suspended Channels**

- Channels that have been deleted by the owner or suspended by YouTube are not accessible through the API.
- Deleted channels are permanently removed, while suspended channels may become accessible if the suspension is lifted.
