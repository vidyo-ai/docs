The **Send for Approval** feature in **Quso.ai** allows you to collaborate with your team and ensure all posts are reviewed before being published. This workflow is designed to maintain content quality, brand consistency, and control across all your social media platforms.

## 🧩 Prerequisite: Team Workspace Required

To use the **Approval Flow**, you must have a **Team Workspace**.\
This requires purchasing at least **one Team Member seat add-on**.

Once you have a Team Workspace, you can send posts for approval to **any email address**, even if the approver is **not part of your workspace or Quso.ai**.
