title: "CutMagic: Automatic Scene Cuts & Changes"
---

CutMagic is a tool that auto-frames videos by using automatic scene change detection. It is useful for videos with multiple cams and helps to keep the subject that is speaking in the frame.\
This feature is only available for our paid users.

## How to enable CutMagic?

You have to enable CutMagic while uploading your video; it is toggled on by default. If a video is processed without CutMagic enabled, it cannot be enabled retrospectively.

You can toggle CutMagic here:
