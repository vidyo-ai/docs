3. **Confirm the change** — your current plan will be changed to the downgraded one immediately, and the different in the cost will be adjusted in your next billing cycle.

<Tip>
  If you downgrade before your billing cycle ends:

  - The **difference in cost** will be **added as credit** to your account.
  - This credit will be **automatically applied** to your **next billing cycle**.
  - The exact credit depends on how much time is left on your current plan at the time of the downgrade.
