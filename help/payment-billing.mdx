## How are subscription payments processed?

Quso processes subscription payments automatically via Paddle, using the credit card information you provide and in accordance with your chosen billing cycle. Please note that we currently only accept payment via credit/debit cards.

## **Do I need to enter a credit card to try Quso.ai?**

No, there is no need to enter your card details to use our free plan. You can start creating clips right away.

If you wish to continue using Quso beyond the free plan, you can upgrade to a paid plan, which provides additional video upload hours each month or year along with many other features.

You can update your billing information in the Billing & Plans dashboard in the settings menu. Any changes will take effect immediately. Alternatively, you can also reach out to our support team to help you with this.
