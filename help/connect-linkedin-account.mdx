### Guidelines for Tagging People and Companies on LinkedIn

Mention another LinkedIn member profile by adding `@vanity_name` or `@[Person Full Name]` in the post text.

1. `@vanity_name` is the vanity name of the member profile. For example, in the member’s profile URL `https://www.linkedin.com/in/vanity_name/`, the vanity name is `vanity_name`.
2. `@[John Smith]` is the person’s full name. For example, if the person’s full name is `John Smith`, the mention would be `@[John Smith]`.

We recommend method 1 to avoid any ambiguity.\
So, in this case, to mention Root Inc., the user should use @rootinsurance.\
\
Example -\
"Finding a Better Way with Mobile Telematics @[Alex Timm], Co-Founder & CEO, @rootinsurance, shares the inspiration behind Root to revolutionize the insurance industry by leveraging mobile telematics...."\
\
Caveats to keep in mind -

1. You must have a LinkedIn company page connected to your Quso account to mention member profiles. If you connect your own personal LinkedIn account, you will not be able to mention other people’s profiles.
2. LinkedIn only allows mentioning people who follow your organization/company page.

## **LinkedIn Troubleshooting**

The most common error you may encounter is a company page not showing in the list of available companies. This can be caused by the LinkedIn user not being a Super Admin or Content Admin of the company page and can be fixed by a Super Admin of the company page **updating the user’s page role**.
