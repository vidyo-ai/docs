# What is AI Clips?

**AI Clips** is your shortcut to turning long-form content into short, engaging, and platform-ready videos — in minutes, not hours. Whether you're a creator, marketer, or business, AI Clips helps you repurpose content with zero editing skills required.

## **Edit Less. Publish More.**

Turn podcasts, webinars, and YouTube videos into scroll-stopping clips. AI Clips automatically identifies highlights, adds captions, and formats them for TikTok, Instagram, YouTube Shorts, LinkedIn, and more.

## **Find the Best Moments Automatically**

No need to scrub through footage frame by frame. AI Clips uses advanced machine learning to analyze the structure and content of your video — detecting natural hooks, emotional peaks, insightful moments, and key takeaways. It pinpoints the segments that are most likely to capture attention on social media, then instantly converts them into ready-to-publish clips. Whether it’s a thought-provoking quote from a podcast, a product demo highlight, or a viral-worthy reaction, AI Clips surfaces it for you — saving hours of manual work.
