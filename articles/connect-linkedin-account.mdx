## **LinkedIn Troubleshooting**

The most common error you may encounter is a company page not showing in the list of available companies. This can be caused by the LinkedIn user not being a Super Admin or Content Admin of the company page and can be fixed by a Super Admin of the company page **updating the user’s page role**.
